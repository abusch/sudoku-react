# A Game of Sudoku

Built with React+Redux, just for the learning experience...

You can play online [here](https://abusch.github.io/sudoku-react). To start locally, run `yarn start` in the root folder and head to `https://localhost:3000`.

## TODO
  - [x] Adjust pencil marks when entering a digit
  - [ ] Check if the sudoku is solved on every move (maybe?)
  - [x] replace `Set` with something else for pencil marks as it apparently doesn't play well with redux
  - [x] Add *check* or *verify* button instead of checking on every move
  - [x] add *reset* button to start over
  - [ ] finish up sudoku generator
  - [x] implement Undo functionality (maybe using redux?)
  - [ ] refactor/split-up CSS to be less of a mess (move to SCSS or SASS or css-modules or whatever?)
  - [ ] add timer
  - [x] move to TypeScript
